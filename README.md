# TDD Katas

Test Driven Development is a philosophy that says you should write tests first, then write the code to pass them.

In theory this will make it easier to avoid bugs and even easier to track down. This is certainly true if you are an experienced developer already familiar with software architecture and development.  But as a beginner you'll probably find it more confusing than helpful for a while.  Stick with it!  There are few better ways to enforce disciplined programming, soon enough it'll make sense.

What is undeniable is that learning TDD early on in your programming life will teach you strong habits like organized refactoring, thinking of code in terms of behavior not implementation, checking yourself early & often, and explaining your thought process.

### TDD vs BDD

A quick & dirty analogy might go like this:

> TDD ensures the walls won't crumble, BDD ensures the building matches the blueprints.

This project focuses entirely on TDD, we will discuss BDD later on in the Testing unit.
