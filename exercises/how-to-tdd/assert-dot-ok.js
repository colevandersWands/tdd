/* assert.ok
  For these exercises you will be using the 'assert' library that comes with Node.js

  this is not the same as console.assert!

  console.assert & assert.ok is similar but have one key difference:
  - console.assert:
    if the first argument is falsey
      it will print your message to the console
      and the program will continue
    if the first argument is truthy
      nothing happens
  - assert.ok:
    if the first argument is falsey
      it will throw an error and stop your program at that line of code
      it will print your message (or a default message) to the console
    if the first argument is truthy
      nothing happens


  The purpose of asserting is to prove to yourself and others that your code does what it should

  It will take some discipline to program like this, but in the long run it will more than pay off

  (assert has more methods than just .ok, you can study those later in 'using-assert')
