/* Test Suites
  in Mocha, a test suite id created by calling 'describe' with:
    - a string describing what behavior you are testing
    - a function that uses the code you want to test

  You can create as many of these as you want, In fact, you should create many!

  Having more, smaller and focused test suites will make your code easier to understand

  test suites don't display anything without tests in them, but they do exist in memory!
  move on in the 'using-mocha' series of exercises to learn more about tests

  (try entering mocha.suite into your console, what do you see?)
